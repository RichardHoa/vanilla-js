# Vanilla JavaScript SPA

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries or frameworksâ€”except for Vite.js, which is used to enhance development efficiency.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how SPA architecture works without the abstraction provided by frameworks like React or Vue. This includes implementing core SPA functionalities manually, such as routing, reactivity, and module management.

## Features

- **SPA Routing**: Implement client-side routing to enable seamless navigation without full page reloads.
- **Advanced Form Handling**: Managed form state efficiently by using both controlled components for complex, real-time validation and uncontrolled components for simpler inputs.
- **Performance Optimization**: You can make the component that will be load only when needed (lazy loading)

## Warning

- This website is a personal project exploring how to build a single-page application without using a dedicated SPA framework. It is deployed to Netlify to demonstrate its functionality. Please be aware that this project was not built with web accessibility in mind and is not suitable for a production environment.
