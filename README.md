# Vanilla JavaScript SPA

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries or frameworksâ€”except for Vite.js, which is used to enhance development efficiency.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how SPA architecture works without the abstraction provided by frameworks like React or Vue. This includes implementing core SPA functionalities manually, such as routing, reactivity, and module management.

## Features
- **SPA Routing**: Implement client-side routing to enable seamless navigation without full page reloads.
- **Reactive Programming**: Establish a simple reactivity system to efficiently update the DOM when data changes.
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimize performance by dynamically importing modules when needed.
- **Controlled Forms**: Manage form state and validation in a structured and controlled manner.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS version recommended)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RichardHoa/vanilla-js
cd vanilla\ javascript/
npm install
```

### Development
To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will launch the application with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.
